# Classes

## A `class` is a blueprint for creating objects

- It defines what properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) an object should have
- In Ruby, everything is an object, and all objects are instances of some class

## An object is an instance of a class, itâ€™s the actual thing created from the blueprint

## A `Module` is a Class parent in the object hierarchy. A module does not use instance methods, but `class methods`. Class methods start with `self`, and are directly called on a module.

## The instance variable @ belongs to the instance object created, not the class as a whole.

## The constructor `initialize` is used to set up an object with initial data when it's created

1.

```ruby
class ValidatePasswor
  def initialize(password)
        @password = password
  end

  def strong
        @password.length >= 8 &&
        @password.match?(/\d/) &&
        @password.match?(/[A-Z]/) &&
        @password.match?(/[a-z]/)
  end
end

class User
  def initialize(email, password)
        @email = email
        @password = password
  end

  def pasword_strong?
        validate = ValidatePassword.new(@password)
        validate.strong?
  end
end
