# Classes

## A `class` is a blueprint for creating objects

- It defines what properties (variables) and behaviors (methods) an object should have
- In Ruby, everything is an object, and all objects are instances of some class

## An object is an instance of a class, itâ€™s the actual thing created from the blueprint

## A `Module` is a Class parent in the object hierarchy. A module does not use instance methods, but `class methods`. Class methods start with `self`, and are directly called on a module.

## The instance variable @ belongs to the instance object created, not the class as a whole.

## The constructor `initialize` is used to set up an object with initial data when it's created
