# Methods

## A method is a reusable block of code (also called a function) that's built to perform a specific task â€” like rendering content, making calculations, or modifying data.

- Methods are defined with the def keyword and must be closed with end. They may return a value (explicitly with return, or implicitly as the last evaluated expression).
- A method is:
    - defined once
    - can be reused anywhere
    - performs a specific task
    - can accept input
    - can return a result

## Parameter -> a placeholder name inside the method definition
## Argument -> the actual value passed in to the method
